## Postmortem
### Issue Summary

**Duration:** The outage occurred on April 24, 2024, from 09:30 AM to 10:15 AM EAT.

**Impact:** During this period, the web application responsible for enhancing the visibility of a specific location was non-functional. Users were unable to load the application, with 100% of the users affected.

**Root Cause:** The issue was caused by the integration of a new feature that relied on a third-party library incompatible with the current Django version used in the project.

### Timeline

- **April 24, 09:30 AM** - The issue was detected when the web application failed to load during a project presentation.
- **April 24, 09:31 AM** - The issue was identified when the application failed to start, triggering an immediate alert to me, the developer who built the application.
- **April 24, 09:35 AM** - I began investigating the recent changes, particularly the new feature added to the application.
- **April 24, 09:40 AM** - I initially suspected a misconfiguration in the Django settings or a potential issue with the database connection.
- **April 24, 09:45 AM** - I explored other potential causes, including server issues, network problems, and syntax errors in the codebase, but these paths were misleading.
- **April 24, 09:50 AM** - Realizing the issue might be more complex, I dug deeper into the problem.
- **April 24, 10:00 AM** - I discovered that the issue was due to an incompatibility between the newly integrated library and the Django version in use.
- **April 24, 10:10 AM** - I uninstalled the incompatible library and installed a compatible version.
- **April 24, 10:15 AM** - The application was successfully restarted, and normal operations resumed.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was the integration of a new feature that utilized a third-party library incompatible with the current Django version. This incompatibility led to the application failing to load, causing a complete outage during the critical presentation time.

**Resolution:** After identifying the root cause, I uninstalled the incompatible library and replaced it with a version that was compatible with the current Django version. The application was then successfully restarted, and the presentation was completed using the previous version of the application, which was easily accessible due to the use of Git for version control.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Library Compatibility Checks:** Implement a process for thoroughly testing new libraries or features in a staging environment before integrating them into the production environment.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up alerts and monitoring specifically for library compatibility issues, which can detect and alert the team before deployment.
3. **Staging Environment:** Ensure that any new features are deployed to a staging environment that closely mirrors the production environment to catch potential issues before they reach production.

**TODO List:**
1. **Patch Django Version:** Review and patch the Django version to ensure compatibility with the necessary third-party libraries.
2. **Update Documentation:** Document the incident and update the projectâ€™s documentation to include steps for checking library compatibility.
3. **Add Compatibility Tests:** Integrate automated tests that check for compatibility between Django and any third-party libraries used in the project.
4. **Expand Staging Environment:** Enhance the staging environment to include more rigorous testing of new features and integrations before they are deployed to production.
